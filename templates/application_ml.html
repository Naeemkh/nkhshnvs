       <h4> <b>Project:</b> Estimation of Q-factor's parameters of the Los Angeles through Simulation and Artificial Intelligence</h4>
       <h4> Summary: </h4>
     
    <p class="text-justify">    The accurate solution of wave propagation problems requires the appropriate representation of energy
    losses due to internal friction. These losses are important because their mischaracterization can lead
    to over- or under-estimation of amplitudes and duration of ground motions. Recent studies show that synthetics
    from physics-based simulations tend to attenuate at different rates than observations, suggesting that current
    modeling approaches need to be revised. In physic-based simulation, attenuation is commonly introduced by means
    of viscoelastic models. Internally, the properties of these models are set based on the material's quality factor, Q.
    The value of Q for shear waves, Qs, is usually defined according to empirical rules that depend on the shear wave velocity, Vs.
    Typical Qs-Vs relationships are (piecewise) linear or polynomial functions. Several relationships have been tried in the past,
    but there is no consensus about what is the most appropriate one. Identifying the parameters that define these relationships
    through the solution of inverse problems is non-trivial, requires considerable computational resources, and may not lead to
    a unique solution. In this study we investigate the effectiveness of an approach that combines the use of an artificial
    neural network (ANN) and a genetic algorithm (GA) to predict ground motion amplitudes and identify the optimal parameters
    in Qs-Vs relationships. We use direct S-waves as a proxy to evaluate attenuation over distance. First, we train the ANN
    to predict peak S-wave amplitudes based on a series of simulations with an ample selection of parameters. Then, we use the
    ANN as a fitness function of the GA, and use the latter to find the optimal parameters based on comparisons between predictions
    and data. As a proof-of-concept, we test the performance of the proposed approach for the case of the 2008 Mw 5.4 Chino Hills,
    California, earthquake. Using this approach we find the parameters that lead to the best fit with data. The results include the
    mean and standard deviation of Qs for each value of Vs. Our initial results for a limited number of stations scattered throughout
    the simulation domain and for numerical models with a maximum frequency of 0.5 Hz show good promise. We recognize, however,
    that Q parameters may depend on additional factors such as frequency, depth, path and site effects, and the nature of the
    traveling waves. Future work will test the method for multiple events and higher frequencies.</p>
